## Contributing Guidelines

I would love to have you contribute to `dndR` if that is of interest! I would divide contributions into the following three categories:

1. Function ideas that aren't coded

2. Function ideas

2. Function scripts that aren't in `roxygen2` format (see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html))

3. Functions that are in `roxygen2` format

Please consult the sub-headings below and follow the contribution instructions for the type of collaboration that best fits you interest/needs.

### Function Ideas

If you have an idea for a function [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/dndR/issues) and tell me about it! Be sure to include as much detail about what the function does (and the limits of its power) as possible. I'll read through your issue and comment on it with any follow-up questions/comments I have.

### Function Script

If you've already written up an R function in a script but it is not in `roxygen2` format (see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) for more info on `roxygen2`) you have two options for getting it added to `dndR`:

**Option A**

- [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/dndR/issues) and paste your function into it

- I can then do the necessary formatting to get it to fit in the larger package architecture

**Option B**

- [Fork the `dndR` repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

- Add your function script (and any necessary data files) **<u>into the `dev` folder</u>** (see [here](https://github.com/njlyon0/dndR/tree/main/dev))

- Commit / push those changes to your fork

- [Open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (a.k.a. "PR")

- I'll merge the PR and then do the `roxygen2` formatting to get the function smoothly integrated with the package

### Function Script (`roxygen2` Compliant)

If you have a function and you've already formatted it
