## `dndR` Motivations & Goals

<img src="inst/images/dndR_hex.png" width = "25%" align="right"/>

I am a big fan of both R and Dungeons and Dragons so I thought it would be a fun test of my coding skills to build an R package that supports this hobby! `dndR` includes several functions that can be broadly divided between functions for both players and dungeon masters (DMs) and functions that are intended primarily for DMs.

My hope for this R package is that you would be able to have an R or RStudio window open while you are playing (or preparing for a session) and could use it to help with some of the fundamental repeated operations in D&D. When I play or DM D&D I often use a virtual tabletop (VTT) and I use this package to complement those systems rather than try to replace them.

## Installing `dndR`

To install the development version of this package, run the following code:

```{r install-dev-pkg, eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njlyon0/dndR")
```

I plan on submitting this package to CRAN in the future but for now the dev version is all that exists. I hope that doesn't discourage you from using `dndR`!

## Encounter a Problem?

If any of these functions break for you (or if you have a cool idea for a new function!), please [post a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/dndR/issues) and I'll tweak the code ASAP. If you're posting an Issue because of a bug, including a [reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) will be really helpful to me and will make it quicker to identify and fix whatever the issue was.
