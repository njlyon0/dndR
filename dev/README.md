# Welcome to `dndR`'s Development Area

If you are contributing scripts or data files please add them into this folder! The reason for this is that this folder's contents are automatically ignored by the package build. This means that if these new files contain any errors (or are simply not in the [required formatting for functions in an R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html)) they won't break the development version of `dndR`.

Contributing your functions to this folder also reduces the necessary effort on your end as you can allow me to do a lot of the specific formatting and focus your energy elsewhere.
