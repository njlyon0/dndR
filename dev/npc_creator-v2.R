# NPC Creator Function Upgrade
## ---------------------------------------------------- ##

# Billy (William) Mitchell (https://github.com/wj-mitchell) forked dndR and has been working on some new/upgraded functions
## The coolest / most-easily integratable (IMO) is his upgrades to the `npc_creator` function
## Working here on integrating his version with mine to get that improvement ASAP
