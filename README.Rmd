The goal of `dndR` is to provide a suite of Dungeons & Dragons (Fifth Edition a.k.a. "5e") related functions to help both players and Dungeon Masters (DMs). Check out the package website ([njlyon0.github.io/dndR](https://njlyon0.github.io/dndR/)) for documentation of the functions currently included in the package. I am always willing to expand that list though so if you have a D&D-related task that could be cool as a function, please [post it as an Issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/dndR/issues) on this package's GitHub repository!
