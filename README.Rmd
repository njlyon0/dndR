The goal of `dndR` is to provide a suite of Dungeons & Dragons (Fifth Edition a.k.a. "5e") related functions to help both players and Dungeon Masters (DMs).

## Installation

You can install the development version of dndR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njlyon0/dndR")
```

Below are short descriptions of the functions currently included in `dndR`. I am always willing to expand that list though so if you have a DnD-related task that could be cool as a function, please [post it as an Issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/dndR/issues) on this package's GitHub repository!

## For Players and DMs

- **`roll`** -- Roll specified number of standard dice and sum their outcomes. "Standard" dice have the following number of sides: 100, 20, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2

- **`ability_scores`** -- Roll for six ability scores using specified method (e.g., 4d6 drop lowest, 3d6, etc.)

- **`pc_creator`** -- Stat out a character of specified race and class using your preferred method of rolling ability scores

    - Run `dnd_races()` or `dnd_classes()` to see which races/classes are currently supported by `pc_creator`

## For DMs

- **`xp_pool`** -- Identify experience point (XP) total for desired encounter difficulty at a specified player level and party size

- **`xp_cost`** -- Find "realized" XP amount by applying appropriate multiplier for "raw" XP based on number of creatures and party size

- **`monster_stats`** -- Return monster stat block of specified XP value or challenge rating (CR)

- **`monster_creator`** -- Generate a homebrew monster with additional immunities and vulnerabilities of specified difficulty (adjustment for these is performed automatically)

    - This function is inspired by [Zee Bashew's video on creating *Witcher*-esque homebrew monsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhjkPv4qo5w)
    
- **`party_diagram`** -- Create a `ggplot2` diagram of party ability scores separated either by player or by score. This plot can be useful in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the party as a whole to help you (the DM) create encounters with that in mind

    - _Huge_ thank you to [Tim Schatto-Eckrodt](https://kudusch.de/) for contributing this function!
    
## Looking Ahead

I know that there are rumblings of a change to statistic modifiers becoming based on background rather than race so once those details are finalized I will create a suite of "5.5e" functions that follow those guidelines. The extant functions follow "5e" rules as detailed in the Player's Handbook (PHB) and Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG).

If you have other function ideas, [post them as Issues](https://github.com/njlyon0/dndR/issues) on this repository!
