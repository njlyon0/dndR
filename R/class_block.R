#' @title Assign Ability Scores Based on Class
#'
#' @description Assign rolled ability scores based on the recommendations for quick class building given in the Player's Handbook (PHB).
#'
#' @param class (character) name of character class (supported classes returned by `dnd_classes()`). Also supports "random" and will randomly select a supported class
#' @param score_method (character) preferred method of rolling for ability scores "4d6", "3d6", or "1d20" ("d20" also accepted synonym of "1d20"). Only values accepted by `ability_scores()` are accepted here
#' @param scores_rolled (logical) whether ability scores have previously been rolled (via `ability_scores()`). Defaults to FALSE
#' @param scores_df (dataframe) if 'scores_rolled' is TRUE, the name of the dataframe object returned by `ability_scores()`
#' @param quiet (logical) whether to print warnings if the total score is very low or one ability score is very low
#'
#' @return (dataframe) two columns and six rows
