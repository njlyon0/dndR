#' @title Re-Roll 1s from a Prior Dice Roll
#'
#' @description Re-rolls only the dice that "landed on" 1 from a prior use of `roll`. Retains other dice results from the first roll but replaces the ones.
#'
#' @param dice_faces (numeric) number of faces on the die/dice to re-roll
#' @param first_result (numeric) vector of original dice results (including 1s to reroll)
#'
#' @return (numeric) vector of non-1 original dice results with re-rolled dice results appended
