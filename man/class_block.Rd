\title{Assign Ability Scores Based on Class}
\usage{
class_block(
  class = NULL,
  score_method = "4d6",
  scores_rolled = FALSE,
  scores_df = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{class}{(character) name of character class (supported classes returned by `dnd_classes()`). Also supports "random" and will randomly select a supported class}

\item{score_method}{(character) preferred method of rolling for ability scores "4d6", "3d6", or "1d20" ("d20" also accepted synonym of "1d20"). Only values accepted by `ability_scores()` are accepted here}

\item{scores_rolled}{(logical) whether ability scores have previously been rolled (via `ability_scores()`). Defaults to FALSE}

\item{scores_df}{(dataframe) if 'scores_rolled' is TRUE, the name of the dataframe object returned by `ability_scores()`}

\item{quiet}{(logical) whether to print warnings if the total score is very low or one ability score is very low}
}
\value{
(dataframe) two columns and six rows
}
\description{
Assign rolled ability scores based on the recommendations for quick class building given in the Player's Handbook (PHB).
}
\examples{
# Can roll up a new character of the desired class from scratch
class_block(class = "wizard", score_method = "4d6")

# Or you can roll separately and then create a character with that dataframe
my_scores <- ability_scores(method = "4d6")
class_block(class = "fighter", scores_rolled = TRUE, scores_df = my_scores)

}
