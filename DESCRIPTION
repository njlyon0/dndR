Description: The goal of 'dndR' is to provide a suite of Dungeons & Dragons related functions.
    This package is meant to be useful both to players and Dungeon Masters (DMs).
    Some functions apply to many tabletop role-playing games (e.g., dice rolling), but others are focused on Fifth Edition (a.k.a. "5e") and where possible both the 2014 and 2024 versions are supported.
