## R CMD check results

There were no errors, warnings, or notes return by `devtools::check()`.

## CRAN Reviewer Comments

- Fixed NOTE generated by `devtools::check_win_devel()` about mismatch between "Authors" and "Authors@R" fields
    - Resolved by removing the names for the vector of information passed to the "comment" part of each contributor's information in the DESCRIPTION. So now "comment = 'website link'" instead of "comment = c('web name' = 'web link')".
